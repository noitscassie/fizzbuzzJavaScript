# JavaScript Fizzbuzz

This is a simple program to play the game [Fizzbuzz](http://wiki.c2.com/?FizzBuzzTest). The goal of this exercise was to gain familiarity with the syntax and idioms of JavaScript, having programmed in Ruby for the past four weeks.

To run the program, simply copy and paste the code into a REPL that supports JavaScript, such as the Chrome Developer Console, and pass the ```fizzbuzz``` function either a number or range of numbers using a JavaScript ```for``` loop.
